###Scope/Outline
Will update this as necessary....<br />
- Have an admin mobile device connect to a sound output device.
- Have other users push a playlist or songs to admin device.
- Admin device outputs playlist to speakers via bluetooth or via cable.
- Admin device can purge/remove songs from queue.

###Tasks
- ~~Create media player.~~ **DONE**
- ~~Create basic interface.~~ **DONE**
- Users need a way to create a party or join an existing party.
- Create communication between client and admin parties without having to manually accept a new connection each time.
- Client application needs to have sound controls hidden and only display a "Now Playing" screen with metadata and album art.
- Create playlist builder for media player.
- Warning dialog needs to appear for admins while connected to 3G and not wireless to reduce data usage.
- Code needs to be optimised to reduce battery drain and 3G data usage.

###Future ideas that may never happen
- Password protect rooms.
- Songs can be pushed from YouTube.
- Songs can be pushed from third party sources eg. Spotify.
- Playlists can be imported from third party sources eg. Spotify, last.fm etc.
- Admin can add other moderators/admins.
- Users have profile page with statistics and achievements.
- If admin device gets a phone call while playing music over bluetooth, do not break bluetooth connection and keep playing music. (Phone call should not be pushed to speakers.)
- More user customisable features ie. avatars.
- HTML based interface, hosted locally. Users connect to local wifi and use the webpage to do stuff. Solves routing issues, but requires a proper local network to werk
