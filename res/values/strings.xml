    <string name="textView1">Hi there! If you can read this, it means that the import has worked successfully! I\'m going to keep typing just to get the scrollview working. Hope you enjoy this app and suck lots of dicks with it.\n\n<b>Posted by:</b> Enderwiggles\n<b>Posted on:</b> 11/01/2014</string>
    <string name="textView2">You guessed it! More pointless words on a page about nothing! Except I\'ve made this one really long to see what happens when the news pieces are really long and boring. So I guess I\'ll just keep typing away and see what happens. Actually I might just make this little bit just a tad longer so I can scroll more.\n\n<b>Posted by:</b> Enderwiggin\n<b>Posted on:</b> 11/01/2014</string>
    <string name="textView3">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\n<b>Posted by:</b> Enderwiggin\n<b>Posted on:</b> 11/01/2014</string>
